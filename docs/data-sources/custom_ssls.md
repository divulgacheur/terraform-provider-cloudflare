# cloudflare_custom_ssls (Data Source)




<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `zone_id` (String) Identifier

### Optional

- `match` (String) Whether to match all search requirements or at least one (any).
- `max_items` (Number) Max items to fetch, default: 1000
- `page` (Number) Page number of paginated results.
- `per_page` (Number) Number of zones per page.
- `status` (String) Status of the zone's custom SSL.

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) The items returned by the data source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `bundle_method` (String) A ubiquitous bundle has the highest probability of being verified everywhere, even by clients using outdated or unusual trust stores. An optimal bundle uses the shortest chain and newest intermediates. And the force bundle verifies the chain, but does not otherwise modify it.
- `expires_on` (String) When the certificate from the authority expires.
- `hosts` (List of String)
- `id` (String) Identifier
- `issuer` (String) The certificate authority that issued the certificate.
- `modified_on` (String) When the certificate was last modified.
- `policy` (String) Specify the policy that determines the region where your private key will be held locally. HTTPS connections to any excluded data center will still be fully encrypted, but will incur some latency while Keyless SSL is used to complete the handshake with the nearest allowed data center. Any combination of countries, specified by their two letter country code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) can be chosen, such as 'country: IN', as well as 'region: EU' which refers to the EU region. If there are too few data centers satisfying the policy, it will be rejected.
- `priority` (Number) The order/priority in which the certificate will be used in a request. The higher priority will break ties across overlapping 'legacy_custom' certificates, but 'legacy_custom' certificates will always supercede 'sni_custom' certificates.
- `signature` (String) The type of hash used for the certificate.
- `status` (String) Status of the zone's custom SSL.
- `uploaded_on` (String) When the certificate was uploaded to Cloudflare.
- `zone_id` (String) Identifier
